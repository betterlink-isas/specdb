# SpecDB Docker

This branch contains some scripts/Docker stuff for SpecDB.

Here's how to use it:
1. Clone this branch to a folder.
2. If you would like to use a different version of SpecDB, clone it to `/specdb` (where `/` is the root of this repository)
3. Run `bundle.sh`
4. The Docker container should be built (assuming there were no errors)
