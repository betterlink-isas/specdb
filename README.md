# SpecDB - BetterLink's specification database

Dynamic markdown renderer - slap some md files in run/specs/ and hit `npm start` and it Just Works™ (sometimes)

## How to use

1. `npm install`
2. `mkdir run`
2 and a half. Slap some markdown files inside `run/specs/` if you want to have some already
3. `npm start`
4. View at `localhost:8080`
5. It Just Works™ (I think)

Note: this is a branched public version of the software, this may not be updated.
