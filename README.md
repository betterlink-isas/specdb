# SpecDB - BetterLink's specification database

Dynamic markdown renderer - slap some md files in run/specs/ and hit `npm start` and it Just Works™ (sometimes)

## How to use

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build`
3. `mkdir run`
4. Slap some markdown files inside `run/specs/` if you want to have some already
5. `npm start`
6. View at `localhost:8080`
7. It Just Works™ (I think)
